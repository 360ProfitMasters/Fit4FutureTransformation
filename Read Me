Well, this should be fun.  How organizations migrate from traditional technology infrustructures is complicated.  How they migrate from traditonal leadership and get "all hands on deck" in the design of the ecosystem is complex..and messy..and fails more often than not.  
For the sake of improving the business survival rate,there needs to be an easier, more transparent structure. Businesses are faced with greater risks, challenges and opportunities than ever before.  Creating an Open source repository for a design will, hopefully, pull professionals for multiple deciplines into the conversation to co-create a process that reduces complexity, confusion and the cost of failed growth and technoolgy adoption attempts.   
It could become the standard that anyone can go to to better understand why their best efforts are not working and what steps are neccesary to nudge the organization in the direction of greater colloboration, performance and prosperity.  If I can fiture out how to upload a file on this, I will provide a structure to start with.
